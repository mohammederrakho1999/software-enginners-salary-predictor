The resulting data allows merchants to send targeted marketing campaigns, track their online reputation, and monitor the growth effect loyal customers can have on revenues, through our flagship web application.

As part of the business operations team, you would be working on various types of systems - from building APIs for exchanging data with external partners, to building web applications to manage business processes, to building out the infrastructure that is necessary to run those systems in a scalable and reliable way. We are looking for someone with at least 5 years of experience building technology solutions that have been used to solve real-world problems.

If this describes you…
You’ve seen several projects through to completion in similar roles, and either has worked or are comfortable working with, teams of various sizes.
Have an eye for idiomatic, readable, and performant Python 2/3 code, and experience with linters/debuggers/profilers/etc. which help reach these goals.
You've worked with frontend development to some extent. JavaScript land moves fast, so we'll understand if your background doesn't perfectly align with our stack (React+Redux+Babel+Webpack, Backbone.js transitioning to Vue), but we're definitely looking for someone who's used a modern framework of some sort, and isn't strictly a jQuery wizard.
You've worked with some kind of MVC framework.
Have an eye for idiomatic, readable, and performant Python code, and experience with linters/debuggers/profilers/etc. which help reach these goals
Comfortable with at least intermediate-level queries in MongoDB and/or PostgreSQL.
Experienced with Git and comfortable using a branch+tag workflow model that leans heavily on GitHub’s Pull Request utilities
Bonus: Have experience with Django, Flask, or AioHTTP.
Bonus: Have experience with JavaScript at or after the ES6 turning point. Trust us, it's a whole new world when you're able to use `import` and `async/await`. We're of course open to teaching these new features as needed.
Bonus: Have experience with both Python 2 and Python 3, and can explain some of the footguns involved in moving between these versions, and in writing cross-compatible code
Bonus: DevOps experience of any form. We’re Docker people locally and AWS/Kubernetes people in the cloud.
Bonus: You’re opinionated about tooling, process, code/test styles, etc., but not too snobby about it. Our process is flexible and ever-changing, and you’d be welcome to leave your mark on it!
… then here’s a bit about what we have to offer!
Salary Range: $80k+ annually. This is based on experience and what you bring to the table
Health, Dental, and Vision insurance
Company-provided MacBook Pro (or similarly-spec’d device if you’re more of a Linux type).
A supportive environment, where you will work closely with a skilled team of software and QA engineers, product managers, and graphic designers
