About Code Ninjas: *
Code Ninjas teaches children, ages 5-14, how to code through game design. In addition to our membership-based monthly program, we run summer camps, day camps, and clubs that teach everything from Minecraft and Roblox to app and web development.

Our unique mission leads to a positive, happy environment that is centered on helping kids have fun at our center. We strive to make work enjoyable and to see each day as a chance for great teamwork and helping kids learn rather than about putting in hours. Because this environment is important to us, we are looking for intelligent, cheerful, energetic people who enjoy their coworkers, love kids, and bring joy to the workplace.

We teach coding languages as well as game design and modding in platforms such as Roblox, Minecraft, and Unity. Experience in Scratch, JavaScript, Python, Lua, C#, Roblox, Minecraft, or Unity are all helpful, but not required. The main thing about working at Code Ninjas is that you enjoy working with kids.
About this job: *
The coding instructor – or “sensei”, as we say here at code ninjas - is responsible for instructing students as they work through their coding coursework. A typical day would include activities such as:

· Tutoring students in their work

· Getting to know your students

· Creating a positive center culture

· Grading coding projects

Over the course of the year, additional duties would include:

· Helping at events

· Leading camps

· Helping with the software and hardware needs of the center

· and more…

The most important characteristic of a code sensei is the ability to build positive, trusting relationships with students and coworkers.

In addition to the options listed above, we are also looking for a sensei who would enjoy teaching coding concepts to younger kids (ages 5-7) in our Junior program. This program is more interactive and requires skills with younger kids. If you are interested in teaching Junior classes, let us know!
This job might be for you if: *
You enjoy kids and believe in the opportunities technological education offers. You are a natural connector with the ability to build trust with students and coworkers.

You are excited to connect with new people and help them see the benefits Code Ninjas can offer to their families and their future goals. You like to dream big and are always looking for ways to improve.

You think on your feet, enjoy solving problems, and are not afraid to take on a challenge. You communicate effectively. You write well and speak with clarity.
What qualifications are we looking for?*
Our primary goal is to find someone who knows how to connect, how to serve, and how to guide others to success. Therefore, we want to see that you have experience in these areas. It doesn’t have to be in the same industry; service and relational skills can be developed and put to use in almost any industry. But we do want to know what experience you have that demonstrates you have the skill and expertise we are looking for. And, of course, any coding experience you have is extremely helpful!
