Our Story…
Western Psychological Services (WPS) was established in 1948 in a little pink house in Brentwood, not far from the local VA hospital. Dr. Morse Manson, the company founder, developed a psychological test that would help returning World War II vets adjust to civilian life. This was the first of many psychological and educational assessments that WPS would publish over subsequent decades. Today these assessments are used by helping professionals throughout the world to evaluate, diagnose, and treat people in need—especially children and teens who have developmental, social, or behavioral challenges. WPS is known world-wide for our industry-leading autism assessments.

That’s the first part of the story: WPS is a stable, successful, family-owned company, 100+ employees strong, engaged in work that you can feel good about doing. This is a place where you can build a career—Many of our employees stick around for 10, 20, or even 30+ years.

Our Latest Chapter…
The second part of our story starts with Jeff Manson, grandson of the founder (and now president of WPS), who’s making a big investment in the company’s future. He’s nurturing a transformative company culture that encourages innovation, creativity, transparency, and collaboration. And, as part of his commitment to a more open work environment, he moved the company a new home in Torrance, with plenty of elbow room, state-of-the-art equipment, and lots of amenities. The idea is that employees who are happy, empowered, acknowledged, and listened to will better serve the customer and the bottom line. It seems to be working—WPS continues to do well year after year!

Why consider OPI, and why do people dig working here?
Variety of consulting; new technologies, projects, and people on a regular basis.
Stability; we’ve been around since 1996 and have a diverse mix of clients and technologies to keep us busy, very busy. And we keep a bench. If you’re not on a project, you’re writing software for our internal business functions or you’re learning new technologies. It’s in our benefit to make our consultants as marketable as possible. That’s good for your career.
No politics or management; we don’t get in the way. Why sit in meetings all day when you can code and be productive?
Awesome benefits; free healthcare for your entire family (yes, free), 24 days of PTO + 10 days of sick time, quarterly profit sharing bonuses, you get paid OT, company trips (to Mexico), 3 company lake cabins/homes, various quarterly company events, new Macbook Pro’s, free beer/soda, chips, candy, and so much more.
You work with the best. Do an Object Partners search on LinkedIn and see the types of talent we hire. You truly get to work with intelligent, passionate engineers that share the same goal of building great software the right way.
Low company overhead. It all means more money back into our consultants pockets (profit sharing) or company trips and events to share in the financial success.

Qualifications

Frontend JavaScript frameworks such as AngularJS, Angular, React, Vue.js.
Modern JavaScript (ES2015+, Babel), TypeScript.
Automated build tooling such as Webpack, Parcel, Gulp.js, or Grunt.

Passion for software development. Someone that loves what they do, that aren’t just in it for a paycheck. Do you have dev projects going on at home at all times?
Aptitude for learning. New projects, new teams, new technologies means having to adjust and learn all the time. You might get thrown on a Spring or mobile project as well, so having the ability to jump in and get your feet wet without hesitation is important. If you don’t want to grow and learn, we’re not a fit.
Positive, can-do attitude. We can teach the technology, but we can’t teach how to approach client challenges with a positive, helpful demeanor. The best consultants aren’t the most technical (although that sure helps), it’s the consultant that will do whatever it takes to see a client be successful, no matter what they throw at you.",4.6,"Object Partners

Frontend Engineer (ES8/React/Redux/Saga),$69K-$126K (Glassdoor est.),"Location: Work From Your Home for our All-Remote Company (USA only)

Are you an expert at React, Redux, Webpack, browser APIs, ES8, and the rest of today’s modern frontend stack? Do you want to work on a web application used by hundreds of thousands of users?

If so, we’d like you to learn about Files.com!

At Files.com, we’ve invested heavily in the React/Redux platform and are looking to expand our growing team of frontend developers. As a frontend developer at Files.com, you will work on all of our client-facing web applications that are primarily written in Javascript targeting a web browser.

Additionally, you will get the opportunity to work on mobile apps using React Native as well.

About Files.com


Files.com is a cloud storage and file logistics service with over 1,500 paying business customers, including Target, Canonical, UPS, Leica, DirecTV, GoPro, Marriott, and more.

Our company consists of USA-based remote employees who work from home.

We’re Bootstrapped, Profitable, and Growing


Our success comes from building a great service that solves problems for
our customers, and our growth comes from expanding and
improving our products as quickly as we can.

We believe that great products can only be built by great people.
So we’re on a quest to find the smartest, most creative, and most
motivated people, and create an environment in which
they thrive.

We Are A Remote Company


You will work from home and have some flexibility to choose your
working hours, allowing you to make time for family, recreation,
vacations, or anything that is important to you.

You’ll take off 11 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20
days of PTO for vacations. You’ll have the time to take longer
vacations and have fun.

As our employees’ safety is a top priority, and we want to ensure we do not further spread COVID-19, we have paused all company travel. Once it is safe to resume travelling, you’ll travel to in-person meetings with your team and the entire
company to meet and work together face to face. These meetings are in
cities around the US, including Austin, Orlando, New Orleans, San Diego, Las Vegas, and New York City.

We think that these in-person meetings are vital to the success of a
remote team.

About the Role


Our frontend developers are responsible for all client-side code that runs in browsers and mobile apps here at Files.com. We use state-of-the-art tooling, such as React 16, Redux, Redux-Saga, and React Native on the mobile side.

We obsess about testing, code reviews, and keeping production code size low.

Files.com currently has many features that are available in its API that are not available in its frontend UIs, so a considerable part of this job will be building out new features and releasing them to customers as soon as they’re ready.

Here are some example projects that our Frontend Developers have worked on recently or will work on soon:
Rebuilding our internal CRM dashboard in React.
Building a browser-based file uploader that works in all browsers, supports resume, and is able to automatically detect the closest server for uploading.
Building notification panes that show “push notifications” to our users about updates to their files or workflows.
Enhancing our security by adding several new Two-Factor Authentication methods, such as U2F, SMS, and Yubikey.
Minimum Qualifications:


5+ years of applicable experience.
Experience building and delivering React/Redux applications that have seen actual production usage.
Understanding of the language features of ES6 and ES8.
Understanding of common browser APIs and recent extensions to the HTTP protocol as they relate to frontend development.
Understanding of how to write secure frontend code and an awareness of common web application security vulnerabilities.
Testing and the ability to write unit tests/specs (we use popular JavaScript testing frameworks)
Preferred Qualifications:


Experience with at least one major Redux side effect library such as Redux-Thunk, Redux-Saga, Redux-Loop (We use Redux-Saga).
Contributions to major open source projects.
Our Core Beliefs


Here are just some of our Core Beliefs:

We believe that the best Engineers tend to be polyglots with a wide
variety of programming language experience. We don’t hire for specific
programming language skills, but rather look for engineers who are
fluent in several programming languages. We want our staff to be
adaptable and ready to evolve to what’s next.

We believe in using the right tool for the job. Our core applications
are built in Ruby, JavaScript, Java, C++, and PHP. We use Rails, React,
Chef, Qt, Jenkins, Github, Honeybadger, CircleCI, Maven, AWS, MySQL,
Redis, Memcached, Haml, Sass, and many other exciting open source
systems. We don’t want to get stuck in the trap of using a language or a
tool just because “that’s how it’s done around here.”

We believe that open-source only works if companies give back. If you
work on any open-source projects during the course of your work at
Files.com, you are encouraged to submit your improvements as a pull
request back to the upstream project. And if you build something from
scratch while working here that’s generic and not related to our core
products, we want you to release that on GitHub too. We’ll also pay
your travel costs to any conference where you can get a speaking gig.

We believe in building products that we actually use ourselves. We are
our own toughest critics and we put all of our products through their
paces every day.

Salary, Pay, and Benefits


Files.com offers industry-leading salaries based on experience combined with unparalleled flexibility and other benefits to secure top talent.

You’ll take off 11 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20 days of PTO for vacations. Go have fun. Don’t work all the time.

We will provide you a laptop and a $1,000 signing bonus to purchase a new monitor, desk, or anything else that would help build or refresh your home office.

We’ll update your salary annually based on your performance, as reviewed by your peers.

We fully pay base plan health insurance premiums (exact plan details depend on your state of residence), and we’ll pick up the tab for 75% of your spouse or dependents if they wish to join your chosen plan. We want your family to be healthy.

FTP and SFTP Server Developer (Java),$35K-$78K (Glassdoor est.),"Location: Work From Your Home for our All-Remote Company (USA only)

Are you an expert in the inner workings of the FTP protocol or SFTP protocol? Would building a server that achieves perfect compatibility with the RFC while still managing to support buggy clients make you smile?

If so, we’d like you to learn about Files.com!

Files.com is one of the largest providers of commercial FTP and SFTP server hosting in the world. Our service was originally launched as BrickFTP, and even though we’ve grown beyond FTP in our service offerings, we have thousands of businesses that rely on our services 24/7 for reliable FTP and SFTP server hosting.

Our FTP and SFTP server code is primarily written in Java and leverages open source code from the Apache foundation (that we have considerably extended).

We’re looking for a rare unicorn who knows FTP and/or SFTP at a protocol level and knows Java to help us modernize our FTP and SFTP server code and implement many new exciting features.

Read on to learn more!

About Files.com


Files.com is a cloud storage and file logistics service with over 1,500 paying business customers, including Target, Canonical, UPS, Leica, DirecTV, GoPro, Marriott, and more.

Our company consists of USA-based remote employees who work from home.

We’re Bootstrapped, Profitable, and Growing


Our success comes from building a great service that solves problems for
our customers, and our growth comes from expanding and
improving our products as quickly as we can.

We believe that great products can only be built by great people.
So we’re on a quest to find the smartest, most creative, and most
motivated people, and create an environment in which
they thrive.

We Are A Remote Company


You will work from home and have some flexibility to choose your
working hours, allowing you to make time for family, recreation,
vacations, or anything that is important to you.

You’ll take off 11 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20
days of PTO for vacations. You’ll have the time to take longer
vacations and have fun.

As our employees’ safety is a top priority, and we want to ensure we do not further spread COVID-19, we have paused all company travel. Once it is safe to resume travelling, you’ll travel to in-person meetings with your team and the entire
company to meet and work together face to face. These meetings are in
cities around the US, including Austin, Orlando, New Orleans, San Diego, Las Vegas, and New York City.

We think that these in-person meetings are vital to the success of a
remote team.

About the Role


As an FTP or SFTP server developer at Files.com, you’ll take ownership of our FTP and SFTP server code, helping us keep it modern, fast, and maintainable, while implementing exciting new features.

These codebases are currently written in Java, and we want applicants to be comfortable in Java, but we are also interested in rewriting these in more modern languages such as Go or Elixir, especially if we can leverage existing FTP or SFTP libraries.

In this role, you’ll work on the following things and more:
Keeping our SSH and TLS cryptography up to date, including integrating new ciphers and curating the list of approved ciphers for maximum security.
Ensuring that our FTP and SFTP server products are maximally compatible with the wide range of client software in the wild (even the buggy software).
Optimizing our FTP and SFTP servers for speed and throughput so our customers get the fastest server experience possible.
Integrating new features such as client-side encryption.
Minimum Qualifications:


5+ years of directly applicable experience.
Deep understanding of the FTP and/or SFTP protocols at the protocol level. Having written an FTP or SFTP client or server in the past would be a strong indicator of this.
Strong Computer Science background and understanding of algorithms and data structures.
History developing and supporting actual applications that have seen production usage with a large userbase.
Complete understanding of how to write secure code and an awareness of common web application security vulnerabilities.
Solid experience with Java, ideally the new features in Java 8 and Java 10.
Preferred Qualifications:


Participation in open source projects, including ideally being the maintainer for a package that sees large usage in the community.
Our Core Beliefs


Here are just some of our Core Beliefs:

We believe that the best Engineers tend to be polyglots with a wide
variety of programming language experience. We don’t hire for specific
programming language skills, but rather look for engineers who are
fluent in several programming languages. We want our staff to be
adaptable and ready to evolve to what’s next.

We believe in using the right tool for the job. Our core applications
are built in Ruby, JavaScript, Java, C++, and PHP. We use Rails, React,
Chef, Qt, Jenkins, Github, Honeybadger, CircleCI, Maven, AWS, MySQL,
Redis, Memcached, Haml, Sass, and many other exciting open source
systems. We don’t want to get stuck in the trap of using a language or a
tool just because “that’s how it’s done around here.”

We believe that open-source only works if companies give back. If you
work on any open-source projects during the course of your work at
Files.com, you are encouraged to submit your improvements as a pull
request back to the upstream project. And if you build something from
scratch while working here that’s generic and not related to our core
products, we want you to release that on GitHub too. We’ll also pay
your travel costs to any conference where you can get a speaking gig.

We believe in building products that we actually use ourselves. We are
our own toughest critics and we put all of our products through their
paces every day.

Salary, Pay, and Benefits


Files.com offers industry-leading salaries based on experience combined with unparalleled flexibility and other benefits to secure top talent.

You’ll take off 11 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20 days of PTO for vacations. Go have fun. Don’t work all the time.

We will provide you a laptop and a $1,000 signing bonus to purchase a new monitor, desk, or anything else that would help build or refresh your home office.

We’ll update your salary annually based on your performance, as reviewed by your peers.

We fully pay base plan health insurance premiums (exact plan details depend on your state of residence), and we’ll pick up the tab for 75% of your spouse or dependents if they wish to join your chosen plan. We want your family to be healthy.

Software Engineer - Front End,$71K-$136K (Glassdoor est.),"IZEA was built to connect the worlds top brands with influential content creators and publishers to enable influencer marketing and content production at scale. With over 500,000 Creators reaching over 3 billion fans and followers around the globe, IZEA is unmatched in its industry experience, network diversity, and technology ecosystem. A career at IZEA offers countless ways to make an impact in a fast-growing organization!

IZEA is looking for a Software Engineer (all levels) focused on Front End Development to join our team.

This team member may be located in the Orlando area or be remote (US) as this is a remote position.

You will use the latest tools and technology to build and support IZEA's industry-leading platform, IZEAx. You will have the opportunity to work with one of the following teams:
The Marketer Experience team
Unity Workflow
Analytics & Data Vizualization
You will have direct access to end-users and stakeholders, and you are encouraged to build and leverage these relationships in your work. You will write and test your code, and work with our QA team to get it deployed to production. With the help of a homegrown, bot-driven CI/CD pipeline, your code will be delivered to users daily.

Aside from the day to day, we can offer you incredible benefits including an annual continuing education budget, a trust-focused development process, a flexible and collaborative work environment where balance matters, stock ownership, and an annual company retreat.

The team strives to be ego-free and motivated only by building amazing software for our users. We seek to understand the ""why"" behind the ""what"". We regularly break out into small teams to tackle problems, learn new technologies, or just share what we know with others. We test our code and invest in the health of our systems. We push each other, learn from each other, and strive to continually grow.

Primary Responsibilities

You will...
Work with stakeholders to define the solutions to development problems and business requirements
Develop and maintain customer-focused features and capabilities for the IZEAx platform
Create unit and integration tests for your code
Reproduce and fix bugs reported by internal and external users
Set goals and communicate often about your progress toward them
Contribute to the ongoing improvement of the Engineering organization and our software
What Were Looking For

A problem solver at heart
Much of our work revolves around problems that have no existing off-the-shelf solution or consensus on best practices. You'll often need to break down large problems into smaller more manageable tasks and utilize critical thinking to come up with novel ideas.
1+ years of web development experience
The internet is a complicated place. A general understanding of what it means to develop software that is delivered over the web will serve you well and should include things like HTTP, CORS, DNS, and SSL. Ideally, you know what a load balancer is, understand stateless client-server application architecture, and can speak about the browser's DOM.
1+ years professional development experience with CSS, semantic HTML & Javascript
This will be your day to day work. While we use frameworks to assist in the development of our applications, browsers understand CSS, HTML, and Javascript. You may skew more towards CSS, or more towards JS, but to get the job done, you should understand how they all fit together.
Experience with a JavaScript Framework like AngularJS, React, Vue, or EmberJS
Modern, API-driven web applications are large and complex, and IZEAx is no different. To help developers stay sane, frameworks have emerged to keep code bases in check. At IZEA, we use EmberJS. If you haven't used EmberJS before, it's ok; we are confident you can pick it up (and like it) if you have used one of these other frameworks.
Experience with a CSS preprocessor like Sass or LESS
For the same reason that we use a framework and tooling for Javascript, we use Sass to help manage the complexity that comes with a large code base that has many contributing developers. If you've used LESS instead, that's cool, we just want you to be ready for using a preprocessor and understand some of the advantages of it.
Basic Linux skills
In order to develop for IZEAx, you need to run it on your laptop. This means opening up some terminal windows, running some commands, and keeping the log output open. Additionally, some of our technology stack is better accessed through CLIs. Examples include the Ember CLI, the Rails CLI/console, Docker commands, Gradle, and our own gemstone architecture CLI. We'll walk you through it, but you should be comfy in a terminal.
Ability to multitask and prioritize multiple incoming requests
IZEA's Engineering team strives to provide a great experience and great service to our users. In order to do that, you may need to context switch into a support issue or drop what you are doing to start work on something else. This is part of what Agile means to us.
Excellent verbal and written communications skills
Regular and timely communication is the key to a trust based development process. You should be able to simply and concisely ask for feedback and direction in terms that your audience understands, and relay requested information in a timely fashion to your leaders. You should prioritize documentation of processes and code.
Demonstrated experience with the following will be highly valued

Interface & Experience Design
Working on the front end, you inherently get an over-sized say in the user's experience with our software. Attention to detail, quality, usability, accessibility, standards, and trends in interface design will help you succeed at IZEA.
Amazon Web Services, or other cloud providers
IZEA's software is hosted on AWS, and you will need to acquire some familiarity with it. Previous experience in using a cloud provider, even if just for developer tooling, shows that you understand some of the nuances involved in working in the cloud.
Ruby on Rails and NodeJS
Inevitably, your work on the front end will involve tweaking, or adding an API to our core back-end services. Since these services are written in Ruby on Rails and NodeJS, experience here will help you understand the greater technology deployment, and how the front end applications are served data.
GitHub
All of IZEA's code is source controlled on Github. We leverage Github Pull Requests for code reviews, Github integrations manage parts of our CI/CD pipeline, and Github releases define the code tags that ultimately get deployed. Much of our process documentation exists on Github pages. Familiarity with navigating Github's features will help you ramp up in our SDLC faster.
JIRA
IZEA uses JIRA to manage projects and report on progress to stakeholders inside and outside the company. While we strive to automate as much of JIRA as possible with bots, webhooks and reports, understanding how JIRA issues, links, attachments, and workflows work will help you understand our SDLC faster.
About IZEA:

We are IZEA: The Creator Marketplace. Our cloud-based technologies connect Brands and Publishers with content Creators who blog, tweet, pin, and post on their behalf.

Our driving belief is that the only way to thrive in our rapidly changing world is to change ahead of it. IZEA is in a constant state of evolution and reinvention. While we may have invented the industry, we still operate like an entrepreneurial, scrappy start-up. Your time here will be exciting, educational, and at times, a bit crazy.

Sr. DevOps Engineer,$47K-$89K (Glassdoor est.),"Housecall Pro is headquartered in beautiful San Diego, CA and has recently announced plans for a Denver, CO hub. We are currently fully remote, although excited to introduce a hybrid work model in the future that will allow for a combination of both remote and in-office work. We are currently open to candidates in San Diego or Denver, or those planning to move there.

At Housecall Pro, we're committed to making the everyday lives of home services professionals better by providing an end-to-end SaaS platform that runs all aspects of a home services business, including scheduling, dispatching, CRM, invoicing, payment processing, and marketing.

Our vision is to revolutionize the home services experience.

Our mission is to unlock the potential of every Pro.

The home services industry remains vast ($700b+) but relatively untouched by technology and unencumbered by a primary competitor. The 3M+ mobile businesses in home services are facing dramatic change as the world shifts from offline to online. Housecall Pro will be there to help these businesses that keep America's homes working navigate their transition to technology adoption.

The role: Sr. DevOps Engineer

As a Senior DevOps Engineer, you'll be part of a technical team that architects, builds, maintains, scales, monitors, and secures the Housecall Pro cloud infrastructure. This team promotes flexibility and autonomy and will empower you with creative freedom and ownership in your work.

You will work as part of the larger Housecall Pro engineering team, collaborating to identify and implement the tooling they need to iterate the product lines rapidly and safely. Your ultimate goal is to enable engineering to help good Pros become great Pros, and you will do that by creating a solid, flexible, stable foundation that enables us to ship quickly and safely in the face of massive growth.

This position requires enthusiasm for the details of code and systems running “in the wild.” You will face challenges with systems running real users and data that require imagination, tenacity, and attention to detail. Curiosity and the ability to learn on your feet will serve you well in this role.

Our Engineering team is extraordinary. We're a hardworking and focused team driven to deliver industry-leading apps to our customers. Our success is their success.

Qualifications

You enjoy a mixture of software engineering, site reliability engineering, automation, performance optimization, security, and operations work

Linux has been part of your life for years at this point and other open-source tools are very familiar to you. Bash scripting accelerates your work. You know which tools to use to debug or optimise a misbehaving instance or container.
You have built infrastructure in a public cloud using Infrastructure as Code. You may have used tools like Terraform, CloudFormation, Pulumi, or CDK, or written directly against a cloud provider's API.

You are familiar with Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment. You have automated deployment processes and created deployment pipelines. You have used tools like GitLabCI, Travis, CircleCI, etc.
You are comfortable with relational databases like MySQL or Postgres. You can optimize queries. You know when to add indexes. You understand how to run these with High Availability, and you know their limitations from experience.
You've worked in an Agile environment. You thrive on iteration. You make opportunities to bring value sooner rather than later.
You value data-driven decisions. You are always looking for opportunities to quickly produce the right data to make decisions quickly.
Communicating your plans and actions across the engineering team is your superpower. You can explain complex topics in simple ways. You know when to listen and when to push back. You keep cool under pressure.
You have experience with and embrace the challenge of building scalable infrastructure under constant change.

Canary Deploys, Blue/Green deploys, automated production testing, or other tools that enable Continuous Deployment.

About Code Ninjas: *
Code Ninjas teaches children, ages 5-14, how to code through game design. In addition to our membership-based monthly program, we run summer camps, day camps, and clubs that teach everything from Minecraft and Roblox to app and web development.

Our unique mission leads to a positive, happy environment that is centered on helping kids have fun at our center. We strive to make work enjoyable and to see each day as a chance for great teamwork and helping kids learn rather than about putting in hours. Because this environment is important to us, we are looking for intelligent, cheerful, energetic people who enjoy their coworkers, love kids, and bring joy to the workplace.

We teach coding languages as well as game design and modding in platforms such as Roblox, Minecraft, and Unity. Experience in Scratch, JavaScript, Python, Lua, C#, Roblox, Minecraft, or Unity are all helpful, but not required. The main thing about working at Code Ninjas is that you enjoy working with kids.
About this job: *
The coding instructor – or “sensei”, as we say here at code ninjas - is responsible for instructing students as they work through their coding coursework. A typical day would include activities such as:

· Tutoring students in their work

· Getting to know your students

· Creating a positive center culture

· Grading coding projects

Over the course of the year, additional duties would include:

· Helping at events

· Leading camps

· Helping with the software and hardware needs of the center

· and more…

The most important characteristic of a code sensei is the ability to build positive, trusting relationships with students and coworkers.

In addition to the options listed above, we are also looking for a sensei who would enjoy teaching coding concepts to younger kids (ages 5-7) in our Junior program. This program is more interactive and requires skills with younger kids. If you are interested in teaching Junior classes, let us know!
This job might be for you if: *
You enjoy kids and believe in the opportunities technological education offers. You are a natural connector with the ability to build trust with students and coworkers.

You are excited to connect with new people and help them see the benefits Code Ninjas can offer to their families and their future goals. You like to dream big and are always looking for ways to improve.

You think on your feet, enjoy solving problems, and are not afraid to take on a challenge. You communicate effectively. You write well and speak with clarity.
What qualifications are we looking for?*
Our primary goal is to find someone who knows how to connect, how to serve, and how to guide others to success. Therefore, we want to see that you have experience in these areas. It doesn’t have to be in the same industry; service and relational skills can be developed and put to use in almost any industry. But we do want to know what experience you have that demonstrates you have the skill and expertise we are looking for. And, of course, any coding experience you have is extremely helpful!

At Puppet, engineers on feature delivery teams collaborate closely with tech leads and members of the product and user experience teams to determine what we build and how we build it. Our team works in an agile, iterative fashion, breaking up large ideas into small, concrete chunks that can be implemented quickly to deliver value or further learning. We work collectively, allowing us to accomplish far more as a team than could be accomplished individually.

You will be using your powers for good!

You should be comfortable with everything that falls under that umbrella too from setting up and customizing themes, writing code, creating custom post types, configuring and customizing plugins (sometimes creating plugins from scratch), launching some truly mind-blowing developments, freeing unicorns and all the odds and ends that come in between. Needless to say, this is one fun job and one badass company to do it for!

Servant-hearted and thirstin’ for a creative outlet

You’ll interact everyday with our project leaders, strategists, other designers, developers, and anyone else that is a “mover and shaker” involved in bringing an idea to life. You’ll almost always be working on at least a few projects at once, sometimes in different capacities but we promise to itch both sides of your brain.

Required qualifications:
Intermediate knowledge of Ruby on Rails with a strong understanding of Rails fundamentals.
Knowledge of common design patterns and how they can applied to Ruby and Rails.

We offer a Software as a Solution (SaaS) platform that connects previously disparate data from within an electronic medical record and transforms it into the type of clinical insight that can help providers determine appropriate care and reimbursement.

You will be using your powers for good!

CentralReach was developed for Clinicians by Clinicians. The story of CentralReach begins at an ABA clinic based out of Pompano Beach, Florida. The company’s founder, a practicing Board Certified Behavioral Analyst, was drowning in manual management of her clinic from scheduling staff and filing claims to reporting on clinical data. She decided that there had to be a better way to manage her operations so she could spend more time on what mattered most — working with her clients and patients. To help ABA practices focus on what they do best, CentralReach launched the first iteration of its EHR and practice management platform in 2012.

Today, under the leadership of Chris Sullens, an award-winning CEO in the technology space, CentralReach is committed to their mission of providing cutting-edge technology and services to help clinicians and educators produce superior client and patient outcomes. Already a market leader, CentralReach is expected to grow exponentially through its four core tenets: hire and develop great people; build industry-leading products; provide exceptional service to customers and continuously invest in systems, processes and infrastructure.

Do you want to work on a high volume server-side API that serves hundreds of requests per second? Are you excited about helping people and businesses collaborate more efficiently by building cutting edge tools for search and collaboration?

If so, we’d like you to learn about Files.com!

At Files.com, we’re building a cloud storage service that challenges the status quo through many unique features that really help people and businesses boost their productivity.

Our primary app and API is primarily written in Ruby on Rails (though we use Grape for APIs, not ActionController, and we don’t use Rails views at all). We have additional backend services written in Ruby, have built our own version of Resque, and heavily use things like Redis and Elasticsearch.

We are looking for Rubyists with strong backgrounds in data structures, algorithms, and scaling to join our team and help us build features into our already great app.

Read on to learn more!

About Files.com


Files.com is a cloud storage and file logistics service with over 1,500 paying business customers, including Target, Canonical, UPS, Leica, DirecTV, GoPro, Marriott, and more.

Our company consists of USA-based remote employees who work from home.

We’re Bootstrapped, Profitable, and Growing


Our success comes from building a great service that solves problems for
our customers, and our growth comes from expanding and
improving our products as quickly as we can.

We believe that great products can only be built by great people.
So we’re on a quest to find the smartest, most creative, and most
motivated people, and create an environment in which
they thrive.

We Are A Remote Company


You will work from home and have some flexibility to choose your
working hours, allowing you to make time for family, recreation,
vacations, or anything that is important to you.

You’ll take off 11 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20
days of PTO for vacations. You’ll have the time to take longer
vacations and have fun.

As our employees’ safety is a top priority, and we want to ensure we do not further spread COVID-19, we have paused all company travel. Once it is safe to resume travelling, you’ll travel to in-person meetings with your team and the entire
company to meet and work together face to face. These meetings are in
cities around the US, including Austin, Orlando, New Orleans, San Diego, Las Vegas, and New York City.

We think that these in-person meetings are vital to the success of a
remote team.

About the Role


As a Serverside Developer at Files.com, you will take the lead on helping build cutting edge features into the Files.com product that drive value for the 1,700 business that use our platform for collaboration.

Our API receives hundreds of requests per second and is used by both internal and external developers.

Here are some examples of projects that our Serverside Developers will be tackling in the next 6-12 months:
Implementing Single-Sign-On via OAuth, SAML, and SCIM.
Implementing in-file search using Elasticsearch with custom input filters to index a plethora of document types.
Building a scalable engine that can convert nearly any type of files to PDF for in-browser previews (like the former Crocodoc service).
Upgrading our API documentation to be automatically generated using the OpenAPI standard, and the creation of automatically-generated SDKs.
Building our Universal Sync engine, which is a tool that allows Files.com users to synchronize their files to other cloud services such as S3, Azure, and Rackspace.
Building a file versioning tool that uses Git behind the scenes to give customers easy tracking of file versions.
Additionally, you’ll contribute to our ongoing projects for improving security, monitoring, and performance.

Minimum Qualifications:
5+ years of directly applicable experience.
Strong Computer Science background and understanding of algorithms and data structures.
History developing and supporting actual applications that have seen production usage with a large userbase.
Complete understanding of how to write secure code and an awareness of common web application security vulnerabilities.
Experience with Ruby and Rails.
Appreciation for testing and the ability to write specs using RSpec.
Preferred Qualifications:


Participation in open source Ruby gem projects, including ideally being the maintainer for a Gem that sees large usage in the community.
Strong experience working at scale.
Our Core Beliefs


Here are just some of our Core Beliefs:

We believe that the best Engineers tend to be polyglots with a wide
variety of programming language experience. We don’t hire for specific
programming language skills, but rather look for engineers who are
fluent in several programming languages. We want our staff to be
adaptable and ready to evolve to what’s next.

We believe in using the right tool for the job. Our core applications
are built in Ruby, JavaScript, Java, C++, and PHP. We use Rails, React,
Chef, Qt, Jenkins, Github, Honeybadger, CircleCI, Maven, AWS, MySQL,
Redis, Memcached, Haml, Sass, and many other exciting open source
systems. We don’t want to get stuck in the trap of using a language or a
tool just because “that’s how it’s done around here.”

We believe that open-source only works if companies give back. If you
work on any open-source projects during the course of your work at
Files.com, you are encouraged to submit your improvements as a pull
request back to the upstream project. And if you build something from
scratch while working here that’s generic and not related to our core
products, we want you to release that on GitHub too. We’ll also pay
your travel costs to any conference where you can get a speaking gig.

We believe in building products that we actually use ourselves. We are
our own toughest critics and we put all of our products through their
paces every day.

Salary, Pay, and Benefits


Files.com offers industry-leading salaries based on experience combined with unparalleled flexibility and other benefits to secure top talent.

You’ll take off 11 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20 days of PTO for vacations. Go have fun. Don’t work all the time.

We will provide you a laptop and a $1,000 signing bonus to purchase a new monitor, desk, or anything else that would help build or refresh your home office.

We’ll update your salary annually based on your performance, as reviewed by your peers.

We fully pay base plan health insurance premiums (exact plan details depend on your state of residence), and we’ll pick up the tab for 75% of your spouse or dependents if they wish to join your chosen plan. We want your family to be healthy.

Our Story…

Western Psychological Services (WPS) was established in 1948 in a little pink house in Brentwood, not far from the local VA hospital. Dr. Morse Manson, the company founder, developed a psychological test that would help returning World War II vets adjust to civilian life. This was the first of many psychological and educational assessments that WPS would publish over subsequent decades. Today these assessments are used by helping professionals throughout the world to evaluate, diagnose, and treat people in need—especially children and teens who have developmental, social, or behavioral challenges. WPS is known world-wide for our industry-leading autism assessments.

That’s the first part of the story: WPS is a stable, successful, family-owned company, 100+ employees strong, engaged in work that you can feel good about doing. This is a place where you can build a career—Many of our employees stick around for 10, 20, or even 30+ years.

Our Latest Chapter…

The second part of our story starts with Jeff Manson, grandson of the founder (and now president of WPS), who’s making a big investment in the company’s future. He’s nurturing a transformative company culture that encourages innovation, creativity, transparency, and collaboration. And, as part of his commitment to a more open work environment, he moved the company a new home in Torrance, with plenty of elbow room, state-of-the-art equipment, and lots of amenities. The idea is that employees who are happy, empowered, acknowledged, and listened to will better serve the customer and the bottom line. It seems to be working—WPS continues to do well year after year!

Who is Scion?

At The Scion Group, we're changing what student housing means. It's bigger than beds and buildings. It's about providing unique experiences and creating communities — both on and off campus — that feel less like a place and more like a home. As one of North America's leading owners, operators and advisors of student housing, we are defining the future of student living.

Taking the student housing industry by storm starts by surrounding yourself with the right people. We want trail blazers and risk takers. Go-getters and game changers. We want dreamers and doers. From operations to accounting, advisory to finance, we're building a team to help us take student living to the next level.

At Scion, we don't just lead the way, we Make Way. How do we do it? We know we're far from perfect and we're relentless in finding ways to better ourselves. You'll come to find out that Make Way is a call to action to pave your own path and to lead, not follow. It's what sets Scion apart and secures our spot as one of the fastest growing, industry-leading companies.

Web Browser Developer,$53K-$81K (Glassdoor est.),"System1 is hiring a Web Browser Developer to join our team. If you are familiar with developing WebExtensions (or even XPCOM extensions) for Firefox - this is the job for you!

This is a diverse role that will involve “hacking” on the Mozilla platform, mostly on the backend. You will work with experts who know the Mozilla platform inside-out, while being a key contributor to novel open-source products which already have a passionate and growing user base.

Key goals for this role: Keep a “classic” version of the browser up-to-date with security patches; update components where possible and create better compatibility with legacy add-ons for the newer version of the platform that supports them. Build system work is required for this role sometimes, but that’s one of the fun parts!

The Role You Will Have
Write code and tests, build prototypes, tackle problems, profile and analyze bottlenecks.
Learn about a wide variety of problems and solutions across a large, mature codebase (ex: how can we improve on the UX, make transitioning from other browsers easier, support legacy add-ons better?).
Familiarity with several programming languages (ideally vanilla JavaScript and python - but familiarity with C/C++ concepts is a big plus).
Work with driven, committed team members to help bring the most customizable web browser to a larger audience.
What You Will Bring
BS/MS in CS, CE or 3+ years relevant work experience.
You are comfortable reading and writing in JavaScript, Python, and/or C/C++.
Care deeply about making the browser fast and customizable (it takes trial and error to make things work on this code base, patience is ideal).
Proficiency setting up build pipelines for binaries with Multi OS support.
Familiarity with debugging tools (Valgrind, GDB) - most of the browser is written in JavaScript and utilises built-in tools.
Experience working with version control systems (especially git).

Bonus Points if You Have
Exposure to the internals of the Mozilla platform (Gecko or SpiderMonkey), or curiosity and drive to learn from experts on the team.
Interest in privacy and privacy-aware technologies.

We’re looking for a multi-talented, many-hat-wearing digital superhero to help us build incredible digital platforms (and lots of other things) to generate epic environments.

We are talking “EPIC ENVIRONMENTS” here!

This role will work in the Creative department with a purpose of turning powerful ideas into beautiful tapestries of art, meaning and uniquely crafted digital environments that reflect and boost the Rodeo Dental mission, culture and community.

You will be using your powers for good!

Ability to analyze, design, document, develop, test, implement, launch and maintain applications
5+ years experience in Wordpress theme and plugin development and testing is strongly preferred

You’ll be working mostly in WordPress and creating/customizing web apps and plugins that breathe life into some amazing concepts. You certainly won’t be alone but you will need to be the master of your domain! See, “Webmaster”!

You should be comfortable with everything that falls under that umbrella too from setting up and customizing themes, writing code, creating custom post types, configuring and customizing plugins (sometimes creating plugins from scratch), launching some truly mind-blowing developments, freeing unicorns and all the odds and ends that come in between. Needless to say, this is one fun job and one badass company to do it for!

Set standards and act as technical liaison with internal partners and external vendors when needed
Participate in a very agile software development process

Servant-hearted and thirstin’ for a creative outlet

You’ll interact everyday with our project leaders, strategists, other designers, developers, and anyone else that is a “mover and shaker” involved in bringing an idea to life. You’ll almost always be working on at least a few projects at once, sometimes in different capacities but we promise to itch both sides of your brain.

Receive and analyze requests from departments to determine most effective designs for communicating both internally and externally
Craft project plans and set requester expectations
Serve as the subject matter expert for Web and WordPress
Ability to coach/teach/advise content owners

We want you to be working on something that you are passionate about and allow engineers to move around to keep things fresh.

Senior Software Engineer,$42K-$106K (Glassdoor est.),"ABOUT THE JOB*
Contracts are the most important document in global commerce. They are also universally a pain. They slow down commerce. People cannot afford to send them to attorneys, because they are too expensive and too slow for the average transaction. Attorneys cannot afford to review them faster or cheaper because they have not had the technology that allows them to deliver contract reviews at scale. Moreover, once contracts are signed, the world cannot keep track of them. It buys databases, and then struggles to keep them organized. Everyone builds a library, but the books are in a mess on the floor.

LegalSifter is growing quickly, and we need someone to join or team as a senior software engineer on our software engineering team, working collaboratively with our Data Science team. We have a team of top-notch software engineers. We are looking for someone to help us consistently deliver the kind of world-beating product outcomes that we all signed up for when we joined this venture. Success in this role will require technical excellence as follows:
SKILLS*

Design, develop, test, deploy, maintain and improve software in an agile environment.

ABOUT LEGALSIFTER*
LegalSifter makes contracts easier. We have two primary products:
*LegalSifter*: Artificial intelligence software that reads a contract and gives advice before a client signs, reducing risk, lowering cost, and saving time.
*Sifter Concierge*: A contract librarian service that organizes contracts for clients using artificial intelligence software, paralegals, and attorneys.
We build simple, affordable artificial intelligence products embedded with expertise. We are doing this to make global legal support affordable. We want to empower people with artificial intelligence, not replace them.

OUR STRATEGY*

We also work with law firms to combine their legal advice with our artificial intelligence to create co-branded contract review software that law firm clients buy directly from the law firm. Law firms increase revenues, expand margins, and make their clients happier with more affordable legal products. We also work with contract lifecycle management software companies to provide contract librarian services to their clients who are dissatisfied because they cannot organize their contracts.

If so, we’d like you to learn about Files.com!

At Files.com, we’re building a cloud storage service that challenges the status quo through many unique features that really help people and businesses boost their productivity.

Our primary app and API is primarily written in Ruby on Rails (though we use Grape for APIs, not ActionController, and we don’t use Rails views at all). We have additional backend services written in Ruby, have built our own version of Resque, and heavily use things like Redis and Elasticsearch.

We are looking for Rubyists with strong backgrounds in data structures, algorithms, and scaling to join our team and help us build features into our already great app.

Read on to learn more!

About Files.com


Files.com is a cloud storage and file logistics service with over 1,500 paying business customers, including Target, Canonical, UPS, Leica, DirecTV, GoPro, Marriott, and more.

Our company consists of USA-based remote employees who work from home.

We’re Bootstrapped, Profitable, and Growing


Our success comes from building a great service that solves problems for
our customers, and our growth comes from expanding and
improving our products as quickly as we can.

We believe that great products can only be built by great people.
So we’re on a quest to find the smartest, most creative, and most
motivated people, and create an environment in which
they thrive.

We Are A Remote Company


You will work from home and have some flexibility to choose your
working hours, allowing you to make time for family, recreation,
vacations, or anything that is important to you.

You’ll take off 11 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20
days of PTO for vacations. You’ll have the time to take longer
vacations and have fun.

As our employees’ safety is a top priority, and we want to ensure we do not further spread COVID-19, we have paused all company travel. Once it is safe to resume travelling, you’ll travel to in-person meetings with your team and the entire
company to meet and work together face to face. These meetings are in
cities around the US, including Austin, Orlando, New Orleans, San Diego, Las Vegas, and New York City.

We think that these in-person meetings are vital to the success of a
remote team.

About the Role


As a Serverside Developer at Files.com, you will take the lead on helping build cutting edge features into the Files.com product that drive value for the 1,700 business that use our platform for collaboration.

Our API receives hundreds of requests per second and is used by both internal and external developers.

Here are some examples of projects that our Serverside Developers will be tackling in the next 6-12 months:
Implementing Single-Sign-On via OAuth, SAML, and SCIM.
Implementing in-file search using Elasticsearch with custom input filters to index a plethora of document types.
Building a scalable engine that can convert nearly any type of files to PDF for in-browser previews (like the former Crocodoc service).
Upgrading our API documentation to be automatically generated using the OpenAPI standard, and the creation of automatically-generated SDKs.
Building our Universal Sync engine, which is a tool that allows Files.com users to synchronize their files to other cloud services such as S3, Azure, and Rackspace.
Building a file versioning tool that uses Git behind the scenes to give customers easy tracking of file versions.
Additionally, you’ll contribute to our ongoing projects for improving security, monitoring, and performance.

Minimum Qualifications:
5+ years of directly applicable experience.
Strong Computer Science background and understanding of algorithms and data structures.
History developing and supporting actual applications that have seen production usage with a large userbase.
Complete understanding of how to write secure code and an awareness of common web application security vulnerabilities.
Experience with Ruby and Rails.
Appreciation for testing and the ability to write specs using RSpec.
Preferred Qualifications:


Participation in open source Ruby gem projects, including ideally being the maintainer for a Gem that sees large usage in the community.
Strong experience working at scale.
Our Core Beliefs


Here are just some of our Core Beliefs:

We believe that the best Engineers tend to be polyglots with a wide
variety of programming language experience. We don’t hire for specific
programming language skills, but rather look for engineers who are
fluent in several programming languages. We want our staff to be
adaptable and ready to evolve to what’s next.

We believe in using the right tool for the job. Our core applications
are built in Ruby, JavaScript, Java, C++, and PHP. We use Rails, React,
Chef, Qt, Jenkins, Github, Honeybadger, CircleCI, Maven, AWS, MySQL,
Redis, Memcached, Haml, Sass, and many other exciting open source
systems. We don’t want to get stuck in the trap of using a language or a
tool just because “that’s how it’s done around here.”

We believe that open-source only works if companies give back. If you
work on any open-source projects during the course of your work at
Files.com, you are encouraged to submit your improvements as a pull
request back to the upstream project. And if you build something from
scratch while working here that’s generic and not related to our core
products, we want you to release that on GitHub too. We’ll also pay
your travel costs to any conference where you can get a speaking gig.

We believe in building products that we actually use ourselves. We are
our own toughest critics and we put all of our products through their
paces every day.

Salary, Pay, and Benefits


Files.com offers industry-leading salaries based on experience combined with unparalleled flexibility and other benefits to secure top talent.

You’ll take off 11 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20 days of PTO for vacations. Go have fun. Don’t work all the time.

We will provide you a laptop and a $1,000 signing bonus to purchase a new monitor, desk, or anything else that would help build or refresh your home office.

We’ll update your salary annually based on your performance, as reviewed by your peers.

We fully pay base plan health insurance premiums (exact plan details depend on your state of residence), and we’ll pick up the tab for 75% of your spouse or dependents if they wish to join your chosen plan. We want your family to be healthy.
